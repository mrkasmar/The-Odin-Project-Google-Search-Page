# The-Odin-Project-Google-Search-Page
My project is to replicate a google search page [ https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage ] using HTML and CSS. However, by no means am I replicating the actual search engine, just the lay out. So far I can say I have the skeleton of my website. I have been applying CSS to shift my "search results" to the right to make it look more like the actual site I linked here. There is a lot of work still to do but updates will be coming soon :). Keep on creating!
