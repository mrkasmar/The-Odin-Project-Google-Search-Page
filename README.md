# The-Odin-Project-Google-Search-Page
My project is to replicate a google search page [ https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage ] using HTML and CSS. However, by no means am I replicating the actual search engine, just the lay out. So far I can say I have the skeleton of my website. I have been applying CSS to shift my "search results" to the right to make it look more like the actual site I linked here. There is a lot of work still to do but updates will be coming soon :). Keep on creating!

I have been updating my changes and have been explaining what I changed (but not why). 
Getting closer and closer to the end of the project :) 

## 3/22/16
I just realized I've been overwriting over my previous updates. Now you may not know the changes I've previously made..but I still think that's ok. As soon as I am done with the entire project I am going to go through my code and begin to write notes to make it easier for you to understand why I wrote what I did.  

SideNote: Since I am fairly new to being a frequent user of github I am going to definitely try and see how I can update my work without overwriting the changes I have written down. I want all my updates to show the changes I've made to make it clearer to you (and me) about what I've changed and improved on. Keep on crafting your work and creating :)
